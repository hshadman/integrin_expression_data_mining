# integrin_expression_data_mining
this is a data mining exercise to track integrin expression RNAseq data and monitor how they change between normal samples and cancerous samples
we mine data from the GTEx database and TCGA database. we track integrin expression data (RNAseq). we monitor how integrins are correlated with each other in the normal dataset and how that correlation changes (some integrins are highly correlated with other integrins that lose that correlation in cancerous data, and vice versa). 
this is a collaborative project. there are some contributions from other people here. 

most of the code is in the branch 'master' 

The project in this repository is available as a preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.19.613933v1
